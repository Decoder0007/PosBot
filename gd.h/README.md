# gd.h

Windows headers for Geometry Dash. Originally copied from pie's textureldr.

# Usage

 * This fork is dependant on [cocos-headers](https://github.com/HJfod/cocos-headers). CappuccinoSDK is **too outdated & incomplete** to be compatible with this fork of GD.h.

 * Certain compile settings can and will mess up some of these headers. **Recommended compile settings are:** 
    - 32-bit
    - Release mode, maximum optimization for speed (o2)

 * You need to add both the `include/` directory and the root `gd.h` directory in your include path for this to work.
